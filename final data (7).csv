"April 7, 2018 11:15AM",biancar,"Zero interest in the car subscription idea. I like my insurance company and don't want to switch to Liberty Mutual (company Volvo uses). I'm not interested in being that locked into the dealer's idea of when I might need to switch cars. For me, ownership only. No subscription for sure, probably not ever a lease either."
"April 7, 2018 11:38AM",Mr_Shiftright,"I hadn't thought about being forced into another insurance company, so that's a consideration."
"April 7, 2018 1:37PM",rkelly17,Also here in PA tax is on the monthly payment. So I assume in a subscription scenario you will pay tax on everything not just the car part of the payment.
"April 20, 2018 7:11AM",PF_Flyer,"I don't see what the consumer gains in this arrangement given how much these cost. Even factoring in what I pay for upkeep and insurance, how is this of benefit to me? As George Carlin said, ""You can take and nail two sticks together like they've never been nailed together before and some fool will buy it"" The example in the article of a 2015 Nissan Sentra for $800/month. I have a 2014 Versa Note that cost me $288/month(highest car payment I've ever had). That leaves me roughly $500/month to spend on maintenance/insurance to break even. I think owning works in my special situation."
"April 20, 2018 8:47AM",stickguy,"price aside, it is the convenience they are selling. and short term commitment. So basically, it is a long term rental, taking their insurance. Only way I can see it makes sense. Unless the desire to switch models often is worth the price premium. I know at times our company had people come from overseas for extended periods that needed a car for maybe a year. This would work for that situation. I know that I would never be interested in this."

Egg-xactly! It's all about convenience. To make a comparison, why would ANYONE trade in a car to a dealer when they could get thousands more selling it privately? But they do, all the time."
"April 20, 2018 12:04PM",PF_Flyer,"I just cannot imagine, even if I hit the powerball, that I would ever be interested in this. We didn't even talk about restrictions on use mentioned in the article, and what kind of penalties would be involved if you messed up this month's vehicle. I can't get the idea of Dippin' Dots out of my head. They found a way to put more air into ice cream AND change you more at the same time."
"April 21, 2018 2:36PM",isellhondas,My prediction for what it's worth is this will quickly die on the vine.
"May 3, 2018 8:02AM",qbrozen,"I think it can work... for the right price. To lease a $36k Volvo (that's the MSRP of the XC40 T5 Momentum in the $600 offer) for 2 yrs/24k, let's use the 1% rule plus tax plus DMV and inception fees due at signing, then add a fairly healthy $75/mo insurance (I pay a bit less than that here in NJ, so I'm assuming this should be enough for just about anywhere). Add in 3 oil changes and tire rotations. Oh, and lease disposal fee at the end. I come up with a back-of-the-napkin estimate of $535/mo. $65 more per month for ""convenience"" seems a bit dear to me. At $550, I may think about it."
"May 3, 2018 10:24AM",Mr_Shiftright,"It's like trading in to the dealer vs. selling on your own, isn't it? You're paying for the ""convenience"" of it. It's a clever marketing angle I will say that, because some potential leasees dread being locked in for 36."
"May 3, 2018 10:34AM",kyfdx,"If the price is right, it could work, but you can guarantee it will be more than doing it on your own. But, I think it's imperative that it's your only vehicle. Might work best for someone that doesn't already own a car or house (that already gets multi-line insurance discounts)."
"May 3, 2018 10:37AM",Mr_Shiftright,Plus you are locked into the automaker's insurance carrier.
"May 3, 2018 10:44AM",kyfdx,"Mr_Shiftright said: Plus you are locked into the automaker's insurance carrier. Yes.. I think Volvo uses Liberty Mutual. That's a decent company, so if you didn't have insurance, it might be okay. I wouldn't want to switch, though."
"May 3, 2018 10:57AM",stickguy,"I could see it for someone in a situation where they will only need a car for 6-12 months. temporary job, something like that. Where buying does not make sense, leasing is too long, and renting too expensive."
"May 3, 2018 11:04AM",Mr_Shiftright,"Well stick, that's what we call a ""niche"" all right!"
"May 3, 2018 11:06AM",Michaell,"kyfdx said: If the price is right, it could work, but you can guarantee it will be more than doing it on your own. But, I think it's imperative that it's your only vehicle. Might work best for someone that doesn't already own a car or house (that already gets multi-line insurance discounts). Which raises an interesting point - if you are on the subscription program, and get into multiple accidents that are deemed to be your fault, can the insurance company raise the premium and/or cancel your policy, therefore nulling out the subscription? Or, is the insurance company on the hook for a fixed insurance premium? Could be an advantage if you have great credit and income, but are a lousy driver."
"May 3, 2018 11:07AM",kyfdx,"Until you turn it in, and find you are ineligible for insurance."
"May 3, 2018 11:13AM",Mr_Shiftright,Insurance companies will always find a way to stick the knife in.
"May 3, 2018 11:16AM",kyfdx,Car insurance is like health insurance. Companies want new customers to be able to show that they've been continuously covered. Gaps are a no-no.
"May 10, 2018 9:38AM",turbo_v6,"Thanks for the post and the info, car subscription can be so pricey at lease to me."
"May 31, 2018 10:15PM",storm10,"To me, someone has changed word ""subscription"" from the word ""rent"". It's a classic rent a car. When you purchase or lease - you are the first and only owner of the car. So you don't have to worry about bacteria from the previous, possibly sick people, holding the steering wheel, or who knows what else happened in this car. I wouldn't want my baby sitting in the car-seat after someone just smoked in it. Plus the performance of the car will be on a par with any typical rental car, when 20 previous people drove it differently and the axles are about to collapse. Plus you have to be insane to pay $4k per month for Mercedes... when you can easily lease it for $400. Am I missing something??"
"June 1, 2018 3:43AM",qbrozen,I doubt used ones are included. And what example are you referring to when comparing $4k to $400? Pretty sure that doesn't exist.
"June 1, 2018 9:19AM",Mr_Shiftright,I think Mercedes subscription service is just getting under way--I haven't seen any numbers yet.
"June 1, 2018 12:23PM",leroy111,I rather just stay with a lease it isn't worth the bother to have to switch cars when they decide.
"June 1, 2018 1:10PM",qbrozen,"? Not sure what you mean ""when they decide."" You sign for a specific term, just like with a lease."
"June 11, 2018 3:17PM",clawsoncars,Subscription could work great depending on the market they are advertising to... Maybe companies might find the best use out of these subscriptions?
"June 19, 2018 3:48AM",idrachman,What is an range of discounts (%) that you've heard of for a Macan base model? One dealer was offering only just about 5%. Thx.
"June 24, 2018 7:20PM",qbrozen,"Just for kicks, I downloaded the Care by Volvo app. When I click on the Xc40 T5 Momentum, it comes back with $650/mo. Did they already raise the price before even getting this off the ground?"
"June 24, 2018 8:13PM",Michaell,Apparently. Somebody mentioned it in the XC40 lease thread.
"June 25, 2018 7:38AM",Mr_Shiftright,Almost $8K per year. I suppose there are lease payments that commonly equal that.
"June 25, 2018 7:46AM",Michaell,"Easily. But, those payments would be on a car with a substantially higher MSRP than the XC40."
"June 25, 2018 7:49AM",stickguy,"Well, probably could get that to lease at $500/month sign and drive. So $150 for convenience of being able to get out in a shorter time frame, ability to switch cars, and the insurance?"
"July 22, 2018 5:50AM",carolsutton_86,"So, here comes in the car subscription. I think I will consider checking and know all the facts first before I will try this. Thank you for posting such useful information."
"July 24, 2018 9:10AM",antoninb,"Definitely not interested, for the same reason that I steer clear of leases."
"July 24, 2018 10:13AM",Mr_Shiftright,"It seems though that these subscription plans, at least in theory, are attempting to loosen the restrictions one normally has with leases."
"October 19, 2018 8:47PM",GamesBx2,"Yes, I think 8k usd! I'm a programmer at GamesBx.com"
"December 12, 2018 12:06AM",bryanfox177,Actually depends on what kind of person you are. If you're the type of person that loses interest in their things in a short time then maybe leasing might be for you.
"December 26, 2018 8:42PM",jdm11,"Chicago area dealers, and/or probably their customers are on crack. Can someone please explain to me how ""general joe public BMW driver"" affords the car."
"February 18, 2019 4:47PM",jasonkimberson,i think the idea of car subscriptions is actually very interesting. I like the idea of being able to change cars monthly if I wanted.
"February 19, 2019 8:45AM",qbrozen,Pretty sure they won't let you change that often without fees.
"February 19, 2019 8:46AM",stickguy,It really ends up being the same as their car rental pool.
"February 19, 2019 8:53AM",qbrozen,But are they giving the next subscriber in line a used vehicle? I don't believe so.
"February 19, 2019 12:29PM",stickguy,Good point I thought of after. Maybe.
"April 20, 2019 10:15PM",PlasticBottle,Subscription isn't not a new idea. It was already implemented in the past in Israel.
"April 21, 2019 9:02AM",Mr_Shiftright,"Yes, subscription does seem more like buying a luxury handbag than getting best bang for the buck with leasing or purchase."
"May 13, 2019 12:09PM",ksoman,My lease payments are less than my insurance payments.
"May 21, 2019 2:24PM",MorePowahhh2Me,wish there was a subscription service where you get a vehicle for 1-3months at a time.
"September 4, 2019 9:21AM",TheMarkusAllen,Subscriptions are roughly double the total cost of traditional leasing.
"September 6, 2019 1:53AM",Howard_wep,I guess oems are just trying to broaden their portfolio and especially want to target the millennials with these subscription models.
"December 7, 2019 9:12AM",Glockenspiel,I never liked the idea of subscription and lease.
